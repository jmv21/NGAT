# NGAT Framework and Visual NGAT Overview

The **NGAT framework** is a powerful library designed for constructing transportation networks using data from various Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Since its implementation in 2017, it has facilitated the analysis of routing problems, which involve determining optimal paths through complex transportation infrastructures.

In 2020, **Visual NGAT** was introduced as a client application that enhances the framework by integrating visual information from digital maps. This application not only allows users to create transportation networks but also supports the export of data for routing algorithms and visualizes solutions to routing challenges.

This project extends both NGAT and Visual NGAT by incorporating new algorithms that address specific restrictions within transportation networks, including robust optimization problems. Additionally, it improves the import, export, and visualization capabilities of results. A new client application, **GraphGenerator**, is also introduced to generate graphs with specific characteristics, aiding in the verification of algorithms operating on these graphs.
